# Random Number Generator
This random number generator works by adding the number of CPU cycles after each keystroke

## Password Generator
I implemented a simple password generator where the user types the password length, and a random password is returned. 
The generator uses the random numbers to select characters. The characters are then populated into a character array where it is printed for the user.

### Note:
Although the numbers may _seem_ random, they may not be cryptographically secure. I would **not** recommend using the numbers for any secure work.
